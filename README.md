### Analysing the cooling of a room with Newtons experimental law of coolimng using Eulers method

This project analysed heat transfer through six different sides of a room by considering the simple model provided which gave variables such as:
- T(t) = temperature inside the room
- T_env = Outside temperature
- alpha_i = coefficient indicating heat loss for each side (i)
- t = time

This code plotted large amounts of data onto a graph which is easy to view

The next bit of code creates a table of 9000 coordinates that plot the temperature of the room against every o.1 second the room has been cooling for. This is so we get a very accurate representation in the graph.

This last bit of code brought all previous code together to proeuce an easy to read graph which shows how the room cools over a given time frame
